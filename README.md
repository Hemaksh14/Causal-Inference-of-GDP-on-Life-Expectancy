# Causal-Inference-of-GDP-on-Life-Expectancy

## Hypothesis
The project seeks to quantify the direct relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy, controlling for the year as a confounder. The year is considered a confounder because it could independently affect both GDP per capita and life expectancy. Over time, general advancements in technology, healthcare, education, and infrastructure, as well as shifts in global and local economic landscapes, can lead to improvements in both economic status and health outcomes.

By controlling for the year, we aim to isolate the effect of GDP per capita on life expectancy from these time-related improvements. The hypothesis posits that, after adjusting for the year, there will still be a significant positive relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy - implying that countries with higher economic status tend to have populations with longer life spans, and this relationship is not solely due to general global improvements over time.
